const COMMON = `You are working on the ABEP-VLEO simulator repository (GitHub ppusapati/abep; primary checkout /home/user/abep). You run in an ISOLATED git worktree created for you (your current working directory); do all edits there. Base commit: ${BASE}.

CONTEXT (read CLAUDE.md in your worktree first):
- RFP envelope (DRDO TDF, CLAUDE.md): 180-230 km, 12-25 mN, < 1.5 kW, < 40 kg, 26,000 h mission, > 15,000 h firing, Hall preferred, air + Xe.
- Three candidate thrust architectures, identified everywhere by these exact ids: 'hall_only', 'rf_hall', 'ecr_hall'. The RF/ECR arms change ONLY the pre-ionization method; the downstream Hall accelerator, feed state, cathode and bus boundary are common.
- Two tracks run in parallel: (1) physics validation (P5-N2 v1 is final: all 9 SGB screening candidates INCONCLUSIVE / NOT ELIGIBLE, credible set empty, gate 3 FAIL; v2 only if independent evidence justifies a wider chemistry domain) and (2) architecture comparison preparation (your track). They meet only when an admitted Hall transport closure is needed for absolute performance. Build everything so it works WITHOUT absolute Hall predictions today and accepts admitted closures later.
- Owner decision milestones: A = conditional selection ('architecture X is baseline provided conditions A/B/C are demonstrated'; does not require Physics Baseline 1.0); B = physics-backed selection (credible envelopes from validated Hall transport, chemistry and common-boundary performance); C = proposal/PDR freeze (mass, power, thermal, life, startup, cathode, mission closure integrated). Every deliverable states which milestone(s) it supports and what it needs to reach the next one.
- Shared naming contracts (use exactly): bus-power boundary module abep_sim/arch_boundary.py (BOUNDARY_VERSION 'bus_power_boundary_v1'; components hall_discharge, hall_magnet, cathode_keeper, cathode_heater, flow_control, compressor, thermal_control, housekeeping, rf_source (rf_hall), ecr_source and ecr_magnet (ecr_hall); ledger(arch, loads, efficiencies)); comparison harness abep_sim/arch_compare.py; thermal/life abep_sim/thermal_life.py; evidence matrices docs/evidence/rf_source/, docs/evidence/ecr_source/, docs/evidence/hall_sustainment/, docs/evidence/cathode/, docs/evidence/wall_life/; experiment protocol docs/architecture_comparison/experiment_protocol/; upstream ICD schemas/interfaces/; ledgers schemas/ledgers/; Hall-map spec docs/hallmap/. These are being built by OTHER lanes right now and are mostly NOT in your worktree: you may read them READ-ONLY if they exist under /home/user/abep/.claude/worktrees/*/ (find them), reference them by repository-relative path, and never copy them into your paths or depend on them at import time (lazy resolution with a clear error if missing; tests must not require them).
- Pre-registered follow-on runs are RUNNING on every CPU core under ${SP}/followon and ${SP}/wt_followon — NEVER read, list or touch those paths.

HARD RULES (breaking any = lane rejected):
1. Modify/create files ONLY under your lane's ALLOWED paths. NEVER modify: hallthruster_bridge/** (prereg, campaign, propellants, audit, ensemble, validation, cases, bridge_lib.jl, PINNED.toml), the frozen P5-N2 pipeline scripts (scripts/score_p5_n2_*.py, scripts/audit_p5_n2_campaign_records.py, scripts/freeze_p5_n2_dataset.py, scripts/report_p5_n2_campaign.py, scripts/make_validation_release.py, scripts/make_p5_n2_launch_manifests.py), existing abep_sim modules (archengine.py, hall_map.py, hall_ensemble.py, intake*.py, compressor.py, reservoir.py, atmosphere.py, plasma_*.py, golden.py, ...), abep_sim/data/**, docs/HISTORY.md, CLAUDE.md, README.md, tests/test_sim.py. New modules are pure and NOT wired into archengine (wiring would be a model change; goldens must not move).
2. Evidence discipline (CLAUDE.md rules 6 and 10, docs/EVIDENCE.md): never invent numbers, sources, page/table numbers or DOIs. Every numeric value carries a source and an evidence class (measured / digitized / inferred / reconstructed / model-derived / assumed) or is explicitly "TBD — requires <what>". Computed values come from a committed deterministic script. No default physical/efficiency values hidden in code: inputs are explicit, missing inputs raise (CLAUDE.md rule 3, no silent fallbacks). Thresholds that are not in the RFP are PROPOSED for the owner.
3. Sources: published / openly accessible only; no contact with persons or labs; no email; no LXCat; no paywall/bot-challenge bypass (abstract-only labelled); never change TLS/trust settings. Cite DOIs/URLs actually accessed (WebSearch/WebFetch are deferred tools: load them with ToolSearch). From memory => "verify".
4. CPU: do NOT run Julia, do NOT run the full test suite, no computation > 1 min. Run only your own new test file(s).
5. Never use screening candidates or unadmitted Hall closures as performance sources; no retuning; never declare an architecture winner; eliminations only via explicit hard-gate logic with the evidence class that supports them. P5 calibration nuisance (registration, coil shape, divergence reading, facility interpretation) is never a design variable or grid axis. Hall-closure uncertainty never leaks upstream into intake/compressor/gas chambers/valves.
6. When done: git add your files and commit in the worktree with a clear message whose last two lines are exactly:
